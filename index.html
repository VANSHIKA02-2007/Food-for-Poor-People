<h1> Food Wastage </h1>
<p>In today's scenario world's one of the major problem is Food Wastage. If we go in a party there we
will see a lot of food to eat but do you think that the whole food is eaten? If you think so, then
you're wrong as the whole food is never eaten because when the party is over and we return
to our homes, there is a lot of food left in the hotel and that food is thrown in the dustbins and on
the roads and is wasted. Do, you know 1.3 billion tonnes of food is wasted every day and there are
some people who sleep with a full stomach and on the other hand there
are some people who can't afford even 1 meal in a day, so they search the food on
roads and in the dustbins and eat that which is very unhealthy. If 
they are not able to find the food on the roads or in the dustbins then they have to sleep with an 
empty stomach. So, food is very important and food wastage should be stopped.

Now, to stop food wastage, I will make an app in which
the ashrams, colonies and the NGOs made for poor people can connect with their nearest hotels/restaurants and collect the food 
that is left in the party. The hotels can regularly send the information in the 
app such as the quantity of food left and the name of the items which are left and their address and then the ashram 
people can see the information and they can go and collect the food from there and for going there I 
will give a map in the app so that they can reach there easily by following the map, and if they have
to ask something regarding the food, the hotel people can also share their contact number along with
the information.To see the nearest hotels, the ashrams can turn on their location. After 
turning on the location they will see the nearest hotels to them, then they will get all the 
information given by the hotels nearest to them and not only the ashrams can go and collect the food 
but also the hotel staff can go to give the food in the ashram. So, the hotels can also turn on their
location in the app to see the nearest ashrams to them and the food required there and their contact
number. On opening the app, it will ask you for the information required such as contact number, address and 
whether you want to see the ashrams or the hotels near to you. If any one is having some extra food in
their houses they can also use the app to give the food to the ashrams but for that they have to go to
the ashrams and give the food as houses van't be detected in the map.
